This is a small excel project to demonstrate the usage of excel , pivot charts and visualizations.

The problem statemnet involves the understanding of the trends of the customer and growth of sales in 2023 by looking at the data sets of 2022.

Some sample questions which can be answered would be :

1. Which month had the highest sales and orders?
2. Who purchased more in 2022 men or women?
3. List top 10 states in contributing to the sales 
4. Highest selling category.


We will start by cleaning the data : which includes : removing duplicates, seeing if data is in right format or not, removing null values and so on. 

We found inconsistencies with the gender column as we could see they were M, W, Men, Women and we will make it consistent by making all M and F as Men and Women.

We found inconsistencies with the quanity as being one and two so we filtered and repalced them to 1 and 2 respectively to match the data set.

Next step is data processing : To do calucations
To find co relations between age and gender we will categorize the dataset into age groups as Senior, Adult and Teenager.
We will also extract month from the delivery dates


Now we can move to data analysis part where we will create a pivot table.
